 * LED Test
 * 
 * This sketch shows how to control an LED connected to a microcontroller pin
 * You must take a warness with the current you will drain from the pin.
 * It must be < 10mA to avoid permanently damage the microcontroller.
 * 
 * You can use and modify this code under your own responsability
